CYCLISTIC - Cycle Sharing Company Case Study: Predicting Demand and Optimization

Overview

Welcome to the Cyclistic Cycle Sharing Company Case Study! This is a Capstone Prject for my Google Data Analytics Course on Coursera. In this project, we delve into the world of urban mobility by analyzing data from a cycle sharing service. Our goal is to understand user behavior, predict demand, and optimize fleet management.

Key Features
Data Exploration: Dive into the dataset to uncover patterns related to ride frequency, user demographics, and popular routes.
Feature Engineering: Create relevant features such as ride duration, peak hours, and weather conditions.
Data Preprocessing: Cleanse the data, handle outliers, and prepare it for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends, correlations, and user preferences.
Demand Prediction:
Build time-series models to forecast ride demand.
Consider factors like days, weather, and memberships.
Optimization Strategies:
Optimize membership plans and annual benefits, based on demand patterns.
Implement dynamic pricing to balance supply and demand.
Business Insights: Provide actionable recommendations to enhance user experience and operational efficiency.
Dataset
Our dataset was provided by Google and is a public dataset that includes ride details, user profiles, weather information, and station locations. You can find the data in the data directory.

Contributing
Feel free to contribute by adding new analyses, proposing innovative strategies, or improving existing code. Letâ€™s pedal together toward better urban mobility!
